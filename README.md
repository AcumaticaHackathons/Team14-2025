Hackathon Team 14 - ACU 3D Photo Booth
Bringing your 2D photo into the 3D World

This project:
(a) leverages Meshy.ai to convert a 2D photo into a 3D model and then remesh the 3D model into a STL file for printing,
(b) leverage Prusa3d.com Prusa Slicer to slice the STL file into a .gcode file for a Creality Ender-3 V3 3D printer, and
(c) deliver the .gcode file to the Creality Ender-3 V3 printer.

The current state to render a 3D print is to utilize highly skilled technical resources to build a model in a CAD system and then process the model into a file that the printer can print.
This project enables uploading a 2D photo to a Sales Order and automate the conversion automatically so that the file is delivered to the printer awaiting checking that the pritner bed is clear
and and then printing from the printer's website interface.
